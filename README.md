Hi, I’m Sanjay K — a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, user-focused applications.

I work across the stack, creating responsive front-ends and robust back-end systems that turn ideas into reliable digital products. With 4+ years of experience, I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture and thoughtful design.

Currently exploring the Metaverse with Unity and Blender, building interactive 3D experiences beyond traditional web development.

Let’s connect and build something impactful. 🚀
